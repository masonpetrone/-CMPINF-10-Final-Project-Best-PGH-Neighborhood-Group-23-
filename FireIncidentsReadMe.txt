This is a notebook containing a filtered dataset, "Fire Incidents in City of Pittsburgh", accessed via "https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh/resource/8d76ac6b-5ae8-4428-82a4-043130d17b02". This dataset will be filtered and each neighborhood will be given a score depending on the number of fire incidents that they have. 

It is in this way that we are able to assign a score to each neighborhood within Pittsburgh. The lower score the neighborhood has, the higher it is placed in the rankings. 

This notebook was created and written by Mark Baumcratz for the CMPINF0010: Big Ideas in Computing Final Project.
