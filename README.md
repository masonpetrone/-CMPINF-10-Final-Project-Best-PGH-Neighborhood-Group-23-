## The Smiling Panthers:
- Mason Petrone: MAP954@pitt.edu

### Datasets (from WPRDC):
1. [Fire Incidents in City of Pittsburgh](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh)
2. [Property Tax Delinquency](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-property-tax-delinquency)
3. [Monthly Criminal Activity](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/monthly-criminal-activity-dashboard)

### About the Project:
In our final project for CMPINF 10, we had to analyze the datasets above to determine which neighborhood in Pittsburgh was the best, and we chose these three metrics because they can show us which neighborhood is the safest, and therefore the best, in the city of Pittsburgh.
